# Discord Private
A simple idea I experimented with a while back.
- You enter text to send to another person or group of people via Discord as a medium.
- Your text is encrypted using AES and sent into a Discord text channel
- Someone listening to the same Discord Channel recieves the message and uses a a key to decrypt it.

It's basically the same as sending a message after running it through something like https://encipher.it/

I have not used this in a long time and I currently don't plan on updating/completing this at any stage in the future.
